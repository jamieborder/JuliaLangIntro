# Introduction to Scientific Computing using the Julia Programming Language

Julia [http://julialang.org](http://julialang.org) is a recent programming language with a goal to
simplify scientific computing; i.e. the multidisciplinary field concerned with the development of
algorithms and computer techniques to understand and solve complex problems.

This site makes available tutorials and examples on the use of Julia from a beginners' perspective.

A focus is given to Probability and Statistics problems.
